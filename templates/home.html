            <p>Tell us the product and the price you want to pay. We will track online stores and send you an email when
                your bargain is ready. Once items are set up, prices are tracked, and logged in users can see their
                items, the latest price for the item on the website, and the price at which the user will received an
                alert. Users also receive a link on each report to go and purchase the item.</p>
            <p>To illustrate, here are some items we are tracking from <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/220px-Best_Buy_Logo.svg.png') }}"></a> online.
